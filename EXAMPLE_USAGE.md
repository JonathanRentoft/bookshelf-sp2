# üöÄ Complete Example: How Your API Works

This is a **step-by-step real-world example** of how someone would use your API.

## üìñ Scenario: Alice wants to manage her book collection

### Step 1: Alice Creates an Account

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "alice", "password": "mypassword"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "username": "alice",
  "message": "User created"
}
```

‚úÖ Alice now has an account!

---

### Step 2: Alice Logs In

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "alice", "password": "mypassword"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "username": "alice",
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhbGljZSIsInJvbGUiOiJVU0VSIiwiaWF0IjoxNjk4NDAwMDAwLCJleHAiOjE2OTg0ODY0MDB9.abcd1234..."
}
```

‚úÖ Alice receives her JWT token! She saves it for the next steps.

---

### Step 3: Alice Adds Her First Book

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/api/books \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhbGljZSIsInJvbGUiOiJVU0VSIiwiaWF0IjoxNjk4NDAwMDAwLCJleHAiOjE2OTg0ODY0MDB9.abcd1234..." \
  -d '{"title": "The Hobbit", "author": "J.R.R. Tolkien"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "The Hobbit",
  "author": "J.R.R. Tolkien"
}
```

‚úÖ Book created! Notice the `Authorization` header with the token.

---

### Step 4: Alice Adds Another Book

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7070/api/books \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..." \
  -d '{"title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "title": "1984",
  "author": "George Orwell"
}
```

---

### Step 5: Alice Views All Her Books

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:7070/api/books \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "The Hobbit",
    "author": "J.R.R. Tolkien"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "1984",
    "author": "George Orwell"
  }
]
```

‚úÖ Alice can see all her books!

---

### Step 6: Alice Updates a Book

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:7070/api/books/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..." \
  -d '{"title": "The Hobbit - Special Edition", "author": "J.R.R. Tolkien"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "The Hobbit - Special Edition",
  "author": "J.R.R. Tolkien"
}
```

---

### Step 7: Alice Deletes a Book

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:7070/api/books/2 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."
```

**Response:**
```
204 No Content
```

‚úÖ Book deleted!

## üîí What Happens Behind the Scenes?

### When Alice sends a request with her token:

```
1. Request arrives at BookController
   ‚Üì
2. JwtAuthFilter.authenticate() is called
   ‚Üì
3. Token is extracted from "Authorization" header
   ‚Üì
4. Token is validated (signature + expiration check)
   ‚Üì
5. Username "alice" is extracted from token
   ‚Üì
6. Username is stored in context for the endpoint to use
   ‚Üì
7. BookController gets Alice's username from context
   ‚Üì
8. BookService fetches books belonging to Alice's user ID
   ‚Üì
9. Response is sent back to Alice
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security in Action

### ‚ùå What happens if Alice forgets her token?

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:7070/api/books
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Missing or invalid Authorization header. Use: Bearer <token>"
}
```

**Status Code:** `401 Unauthorized`

---

### ‚ùå What happens if Bob tries to access Alice's books?

Bob logs in and gets his own token. Then he tries to see books:

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:7070/api/books \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <BOB_TOKEN>"
```

**Response:**
```json
[]
```

Bob gets an empty list because he doesn't have any books! He can't see Alice's books because:
1. Bob's token contains "bob" as username
2. The API only fetches books where `user_id = bob's user ID`
3. Alice's books have `user_id = alice's user ID`

‚úÖ **Each user's data is completely isolated!**

---

### ‚ùå What happens with an expired token?

After 24 hours, Alice's token expires. If she tries to use it:

**Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid or expired token"
}
```

**Status Code:** `401 Unauthorized`

Alice needs to login again to get a new token!

---

## üéØ Key Takeaways

1. **Authentication = Login** ‚Üí Proves you are who you say you are
2. **Token = Your Pass** ‚Üí Like a movie ticket, proves you're authenticated
3. **Authorization Header** ‚Üí How you show your pass
4. **User Isolation** ‚Üí You can only see YOUR data
5. **24 Hour Expiry** ‚Üí Tokens don't last forever (security!)

---

## üß™ Try It Yourself!

1. Start your server: Run `Main.java`
2. Open the `test.http` file
3. Execute requests from top to bottom
4. Watch the magic happen! ‚ú®

---

## üí° Why This Matters

**Without JWT (Insecure):**
```
GET /api/books?username=alice
```
Anyone can pretend to be Alice by just typing her username!

**With JWT (Secure):**
```
GET /api/books
Authorization: Bearer <signed-token-that-only-Alice-has>
```
You need Alice's token, which requires her password to get!
