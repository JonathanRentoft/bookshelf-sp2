### 5. Digital Ocean Droplet Setup üåä
- [ ] Droplet created (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended)
- [ ] SSH access configured
- [ ] Docker installed on droplet
- [ ] Docker Compose installed on droplet
- [ ] Caddy installed on droplet (if using HTTPS)

### 6. Droplet Configuration üîß
SSH into your droplet and complete:

- [ ] Created directory: `/root/bookshelf-api`
- [ ] Created `.env` file with:
  ```
  DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
  DOCKER_USERNAME=your_dockerhub_username
  ```
- [ ] Uploaded `docker-compose.yml` to droplet
- [ ] Firewall configured:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow 22/tcp   # SSH
  sudo ufw allow 80/tcp   # HTTP
  sudo ufw allow 443/tcp  # HTTPS
  sudo ufw enable
  ```

### 7. Domain & DNS (Optional for HTTPS) üåê
- [ ] Domain purchased or subdomain configured
- [ ] DNS A record pointing to droplet IP
- [ ] DNS propagation completed (check with `nslookup yourdomain.com`)
- [ ] Caddyfile updated with your domain
- [ ] Caddy restarted: `sudo systemctl restart caddy`

### 8. Initial Deployment üöÄ
- [ ] Pushed code to GitHub `main` or `master` branch
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow triggered
- [ ] Build completed successfully
- [ ] Tests passed
- [ ] Docker image pushed to Docker Hub
- [ ] Deployment to droplet successful

### 9. Verification ‚úÖ
Test these on your deployed API:

- [ ] Route overview accessible: `https://yourdomain.com/api/routes`
- [ ] Can register a user: `POST /api/auth/register`
- [ ] Can login: `POST /api/auth/login`
- [ ] Can create a book: `POST /api/books` (with JWT)
- [ ] Can get books: `GET /api/books` (with JWT)
- [ ] HTTPS working (green lock in browser)
- [ ] Logs are accessible: `docker-compose logs -f`

### 10. Monitoring & Maintenance üìä
- [ ] Watchtower running (auto-updates containers)
- [ ] Database backups configured
- [ ] Logs being monitored
- [ ] SSL certificate auto-renewal working (Caddy handles this)

## Quick Verification Commands

Run these on your droplet:

```bash
# Check containers are running
docker-compose ps

# Check API logs
docker-compose logs -f bookshelf-api

# Check database logs
docker-compose logs -f postgres

# Check Caddy status
sudo systemctl status caddy

# Test API locally on droplet
curl http://localhost:7070/api/routes

# Check disk space
df -h

# Check memory
free -m
```

## Troubleshooting Checklist

If something isn't working:

- [ ] Checked GitHub Actions logs
- [ ] Checked Docker container logs
- [ ] Verified environment variables in `.env`
- [ ] Verified database is running and healthy
- [ ] Verified firewall allows correct ports
- [ ] Verified DNS is pointing to correct IP
- [ ] Checked Caddy configuration and logs
- [ ] Verified Docker Hub credentials are correct
- [ ] Verified droplet has enough resources

## Security Checklist üîí

- [ ] Changed default database password
- [ ] JWT secret is secure (in code or env var)
- [ ] Firewall is enabled
- [ ] SSH key authentication enabled (password disabled)
- [ ] Regular security updates scheduled
- [ ] Logs monitored for suspicious activity
- [ ] Database backups configured
- [ ] HTTPS enabled and working

## Documentation Checklist üìö

- [ ] README.md updated with correct information
- [ ] Deployment documentation matches your setup
- [ ] Test credentials documented (if any)
- [ ] API endpoints documented
- [ ] Known issues documented
- [ ] Contact information for support
